# Connect 4 using DQN
This is the midterm project for CS-5410 (Reinforcement Learning). I trained an agent to play Connect-4 against a random opponent using Deep Q Learning

## Future Additions
- Code up an agent using Monte Carlo Tree Search
- Code up an agent using MiniMax
- Train my agent against the above agents
- Come up with a better architecture for the neural network
